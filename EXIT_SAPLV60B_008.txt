To find and use EXIT_SAPLV60B_008 in SAP for modifying the accounting interface items table XACCIT, follow these steps:
Finding the User Exit
Start by using transaction SE37 in SAP and enter EXIT_SAPLV60B_008 to view the function module details. This helps you see where the exit is located in the system.

Implementing the User Exit
Go to transaction CMOD to create or manage an enhancement project. This is where youâ€™ll add your custom code.

Assign the enhancement SDVFX008 to your project, as this is where EXIT_SAPLV60B_008 is included.

Activate the project to enable the changes.

Find the function module EXIT_SAPLV60B_008 in the project components, then double-click the include program ZXVVFU08 to edit it.

Write your custom ABAP code in ZXVVFU08 to modify XACCIT or other relevant tables for your billing process needs.

Finally, activate the include program and ensure the project is active for the changes to take effect.

An unexpected detail is that much of the practical guidance for this comes from SAP community discussions, as official documentation may not always detail implementation steps, relying on user experiences for clarity.
